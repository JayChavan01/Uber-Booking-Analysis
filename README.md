### **Key Features & Functionalities:**  

1. **Data Processing & Cleaning:**  
   - Imported and cleaned the Uber booking dataset using Python.  
   - Handled missing values, duplicate records, and incorrect data entries.  

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):**  
   - Identified ride booking trends across different time periods.  
   - Analyzed customer booking behavior based on location and time.  
   - Examined the most frequently used ride categories and pricing patterns.  

3. **Key Insights & Metrics:**  
   - Total number of bookings during different time periods.  
   - Peak booking hours and days of the week.  
   - Distribution of rides across different cities.  
   - Average ride fare and its variation by time and location.  
   - Top ride categories preferred by users.  

4. **Visualizations:**  
   - **Ride Booking Trends:** Tracking the number of bookings over time.  
   - **Customer Demographics:** Analyzing ride patterns based on location.  
   - **Peak Hours Analysis:** Identifying the busiest hours for ride bookings.  
   - **City-wise Ride Distribution:** Mapping Uber rides across different regions.  
   - **Price Trends:** Understanding fare variations based on ride demand.

### **Tools & Technologies Used:**  
- **Jupyter Notebook** (for analysis and visualization)  
- **Google Colab** (for cloud-based execution and collaboration)  
- **Python Libraries:**  
  - `pandas` (for data manipulation)  
  - `matplotlib` & `seaborn` (for visualization)  
  - `numpy` (for numerical operations)

### **Output Example:**  

- **Input Data:**  
   The Uber booking dataset containing ride details, customer locations, ride categories, and fare amounts.  

- **Data Processing & Cleaning:**  
   Ensured data consistency, removed duplicates, and handled missing values.  

- **Generated Insights & Visualizations:**  
   - **Ride Demand Analysis:** Displays peak ride booking times and locations.  
   - **Customer Preferences:** Identifies popular ride categories and fare structures.  
   - **Geographical Analysis:** Highlights the busiest pickup and drop-off locations.  
   - **Price & Fare Trends:** Analyzes fluctuations in ride fares based on demand and time.  

This project showcases my **data analysis skills** using **Python** to extract valuable insights from Uber ride data, helping businesses optimize ride pricing and demand forecasting. ðŸš€
